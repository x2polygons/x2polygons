# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.
#
# This file only contains a selection of the most common options. For a full
# list see the documentation:
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys
from pathlib import Path

sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../../x2polygons'))

# go up two levels from /docs/source to the package root
#sys.path.insert(0, str(Path().resolve().parent.parent))

# mock import these packages because readthedocs doesn't have them installed
# autodoc_mock_imports = [
#     "distance_functions",
#     "plot",
# ]

# -- Project information -----------------------------------------------------

project = 'x2polygons'
copyright = '2022 x2polygons'
author = 'x2polygons'

# The full version, including alpha/beta/rc tags
release = '0.0.1'


# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc',
              'sphinx_rtd_theme'
]

# If we want to creat the documentation as in the source code and not alphabetically
autodoc_member_order = 'bysource'

# Napoleon settings
napoleon_google_docstring = True

# Add any paths that contain templates here, relative to this directory.
templates_path = ['_templates']

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.
exclude_patterns = ['_build', 'Thumbs.db', '.DS_Store']


# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.
#
html_theme = 'sphinx_rtd_theme'

# Add any paths that contain custom static files (such as style sheets) here,
# relative to this directory. They are copied after the builtin static files,
# so a file named "default.css" will overwrite the builtin "default.css".
html_static_path = ['_static']
