Welcome to x2Polygons's documentation!
======================================

x2Polygons is a Python package that allows the distance computation between two matching (homologous) polygons.
In order to measure the data quality of, for example OpenStreetMap building footprints, it is often necessary 
to first find matching building footprints between OSM and the reference dataset and then utilise different distance functions.


Installation
============

You may install the package by using pip as follows:
::
    
    pip install x2Polygons
